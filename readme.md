## What is Brutal CSS?

Brutal CSS is an immature expression of my frustration with other brutalist website nerds who don't include the one meta tag that makes your website work on mobile.

Look, it's called scaling and we hate it. They're called phones and we hate them too. But you gotta do it. You just gotta.

### Wow this is so perfect and amazing, can you make it available on a CDN for me?

No! I don't trust y'all! You have lost my trust! Far and away the most important part of this CSS framework (:sweat_smile:) *is not even CSS* and so can't be served from a CDN:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

SCALE YOUR THING. I WANT TO READ YOUR THING ON MY PHONE. SCALE IT.

### OK, jeez calm down. Why'd you style the `<pre>` tag?

Look I just know my audience. Please scale your thing.
